            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-white title-font mb-2">Is it better to be a Web Designer or Web Developer? <br><br></h2> <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-white title-font mb-2" style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:-</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">I agree with those that say being both is definitely better. <br> 
              <br>

              But being a designer is not easier. <br><br>
              
              Coding is finite; once you learn the code, the code doesn’t change (not counting new advances in technology, which happen relatively slowly). <br><br>
              
              But design is fluid; it’s ever-evolving and trends change more quickly. You have to have a solid core of classic design skills (layout, typography, color theory, etc), plus be able to envision how to make that design responsive for all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop), plus have knowledge of ADA/WCAG accessibility compliance, have a deep understanding of UX best practices, and be able to take criticism and constructive feedback when working with the business and all their vast opinions, but also be able to push back on the business and know that what they WANT isn’t always what they NEED. <br><br>
              
              Developers, I’ve learned, don’t ask questions; they just do whatever is asked of them. Designers know that there’s a difference between what is being asked for, and what the client or user actually needs, and they look for the best design solutions to make everyone happy (without wasting time creating something that the business, hundreds of working hours later, discovers isn’t quite what they need, and then has to waste more developer hours enhancing their original request. [I like to call this The Band-Aid Effect, because the results usually aren’t as good as if it had been thought through and done correctly the first time.]). <br><br>
              
              Being a designer that also knows how to code can be very valuable to a company (though most companies don’t realize the value and continue to keep UX design and UI development as separate positions). As a UX Developer, my understanding of how to code good responsive layouts, and write my own CSS (or Bootstrap overrides), frees up my developers to focus on what they’re good at: Angular and .NET. They love the fact that I can give them an HTML shell (with linked CSS), and they can just hook in the back end functionality stuff. They aren’t as savvy with CSS as I am (by far), and my work takes that added stress off of them. They don’t need to worry about translating a static design into code. When I’ve worked for companies that keep design and development separate, both the developers and I end up being super frustrated, because my designs (which I’ve designed, knowing how I’d code it) never get translated the way I intended; the layout breaks at smaller screens, or fonts are wrong, or padding/spacing is off or inconsistent, or even punctuation/spelling/grammar is missing. The developers are frustrated, because I’m being “picky,” and who cares if there’s a missing colon or a space before a period, the page *works,* doesn’t it? Designers have to pay attention to all the tiny details that make a site professional, that most developers don’t have the aptitude or patience for.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">Well, this is the greatest confusion which is quite tricky to get rid of especially when you are thinking of designing a website for your business. Most of the business owners get addled amongest these terms for the full construction of a website.</p>
